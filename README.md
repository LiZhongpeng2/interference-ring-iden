# Interference Pattern Center Detection

A computer vision algorithm that automatically detects the center of circular interference patterns in optical images.

## Features
- Image preprocessing with thresholding and noise removal
- Connected component analysis for feature isolation
- Voting-based center detection algorithm using edge normal vectors

## Usage
Run the notebooks:
- `finder_main.ipynb`: Main processing pipeline
- `finder_finder_fun.ipynb`: Center detection algorithm implementation

Or use the Python modules in `code/`:
```
python code/main.py
```

See `code/requirements.txt` for complete dependencies.
