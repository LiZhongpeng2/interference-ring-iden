    "### Circle Center Detection Function\n",
    "\n",
    "The circle center detection is based on a **normal intersection voting method**:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Edge Extraction**: First, we extract the edges of the cleaned binary image using Canny edge detection to identify potential boundary points of the circular pattern.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Gradient Calculation**: For each edge pixel, we compute the gradient vector (using Sobel operators) which represents the direction of intensity change and helps determine the edge normal direction.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Voting along Normals**: Each edge point votes for possible circle centers by projecting votes along the normal directions (both inward and outward) within a defined radius range. This accumulates votes in an accumulator space.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Finding the Peak Vote**: The pixel with the highest vote count in the accumulator is selected as the estimated circle center, since normals from many edge points intersect there.\n",
    "\n",
    "This method is robust to noise and slight shape distortions, making it suitable for detecting approximate geometric centers in interference fringe patterns or similar circular features.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "After multiple rounds of testing and parameter tuning, this voting-based circle center detection method consistently delivers reliable and accurate results. The accumulator heatmap clearly highlights the peak vote region, and the detected center aligns well with the visual center of the circular patterns.\n",
    "\n",
    "The following figures illustrate typical detection outcomes, demonstrating the methodâ€™s robustness and effectiveness across varied samples and noise conditions.\n",
